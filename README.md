# Sensitivity of Deep Learning Applied to Spatial Image Steganalysis
In recent years, the traditional approach to spatial image steganalysis has shifted to Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which have improved the detection accuracy while combining feature extraction and classification in a single model, usually, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main contribution from researchers in this area are new architectures that further improve the detection accuracy. Nevertheless, the preprocessing and partition of the database impact the overall performance of CNN. This paper presents the results achieved by two steganalysis networks (XU-Net and YE-Net) using different combinations of image and filter normalization ranges, other database partitions, diverse composition of the training mini-batches, different activation functions for the preprocessing stage, as well as an analysis on the activation maps and how to report accuracy. These results demonstrate how sensible are steganalysis systems to changes in any stage of the process, and how important it is for researchers in this field to register and report their work thoroughly.
